# Aura

A floating HUD for real-time AI coding session awareness.

## What is Aura?

Aura monitors AI coding agents as they work, displaying session state and active tools without taking up screen space. Built with Rust/gpui for native macOS performance.

**Key features:**
- Real-time tool visibility (Read, Write, Grep, Bash, etc.)
- Six session states: Running, Idle, Attention, Waiting, Compacting, Stale
- Multi-session tracking with minimal 36×36 collapsed indicator
- Three themes: System, Liquid Dark/Light
- Supports Claude Code (hooks) and Codex (session rollouts)
